1. Make a Scroll To Top Component in React :- The component should be visible only when user scrolls the page. Component should be Re-usable and it styles should be customisable like "background-color, position(top,left,right,bottom)". Component offset (distance from the top when the component would be visible) should pass from the Props. Note:- Use React-font awesome for Arrow sign.

2. Make Twitter Tweet like plugin, where Tweet button style should change dynamically according to state. For eg;- Tweet button should be not clickable if user is submitting blank tweet or he exceeds maximum character limit. Once the user types,Tweet button should be visible.
